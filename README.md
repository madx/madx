## About me

I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in France with over 10 years of experience across a variety of industries and organizational types.
I'm a strong advocate for asynchronous work, and I've spent half of my career thriving in remote environments.
I believe software should be accessible to everyone, and the code behind it should embrace the same mindset.
